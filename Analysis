Statistical Test Used and Output
The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between ratings and rating counts. Results showed a positive correlation coefficient of 0.72 with a p-value < 0.001, indicating a statistically significant correlation. This suggests that products with higher rating counts tend to receive better ratings.
4.2. Hypothesis Decision Based on P-Value
Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis (Hâ‚€). The significant positive correlation implies a meaningful relationship between product ratings and rating counts. Products with more reviews generally receive higher ratings, reflecting consumer trust. However, further analysis is needed to account for potential confounding factors such as product categories or pricing.
